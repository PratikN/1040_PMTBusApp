Pune Bus App will search the online schedule of the PMPML Bus Routes and provide the user with a list of routes that will take him/her to their desired destination from their starting location. The app will display the bus numbers as well as the timings of the buses, starting from the next available bus according to the current time.

After the initial update, the app can be used offline. Enter a source and a destination and click 'find'. The database will be searched for matching bus stops, and return the results in a list.
